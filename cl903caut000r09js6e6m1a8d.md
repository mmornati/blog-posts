# Connectors: Apple vs Sumsung

Or, in other words, "when someone really love Apple and became blind"!
Reading this <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/190779/apple-vs-samsung-a-decade-of-proprietary-connectors-humor/" target="_blank">article</a> I noticed that sometimes people talk without connecting the brain. Apple produce only 2 proprietary phone connectors in the latest 10 years, and Samsung hundreds.

Yes, that's true, but: how many phones produced Samsung in 10 years, and how many Apple?

You can check easily looking these pages:

Samsun: <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/samsung-phones-9.php" target="_blank">http://www.gsmarena.com/samsung-phones-9.php</a>
Apple: Do you really need a page to count the Apple iPhones?

So:
Samsung 18 adapters and 809 phones: <strong>2,22%</strong>
Apple 2 adapters 7 phones: <strong>28,5%</strong>

Yes, Apple can change adapter but it's not necessary to talk about it as the event of the year and attack anyone saying that Apple changes to a proprietary connector and not to a standard. That's true!! Other companies are converging to the same connector (the micro usb) Apple prefers the proprietary one. You know Apple (yes you <a href="http://www.melablog.it/post/32691/ladattatore-lightning-microusb-disponibile-solo-in-ue" target="_blank">know</a>!!) in Europe you should use the standard!
