# ePomodoro: completed version 1.0

Yesterday I <a href="http://blog.mornati.net/2012/02/26/epomodoro-eclipse-plugin-for-pomodoro-technology-with-team-communication/">talked </a>about an Eclipse plugin to use with Pomodoro Technique created by me just to have a broadcast communication for dev team with information about your Pomodoro.

Today I spent one hour more to "complete" the first version of this plugin, that is now completely usable for your time management.
It is really simple, composed by just two View. <strong>Team Status</strong> view: a table with your team pomodoro information;  <strong>CountDown Timer</strong>: view where you can manage you Pomodoro; start, pause and reset your timer.
In this version you can decide, in the settings page, to auto start your pause timer after the work one, or manage all your timers by hand.

Have a good Pomodoro ;)
