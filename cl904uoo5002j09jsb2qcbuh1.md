If you link your DropBox account to your phone and you use it to automatically upload taken photos and videos, the cloud settings are, by default, configured to make a local backup of all camera upload images/videos. That means, after a while your cache will take lot of space on your phone (in the cloudagent/cache/root/ folder).

You can check and disable this settings going into <strong>Settings -&gt; Cloud</strong> menu and then selecting <strong>Pictures</strong> and <strong>Videos </strong> menus to check if the cache is activated and to disable it.
When you disable it, all local (cached) files are automatically deleted (but Dropbox uploaded photos and local taken photos are not impacted!!)
