## Introduction

If you've ever deployed a web application, you know the pain: push a small frontend change, wait for the entire platform to restart, and watch your users experience downtime. For the Cyber Code Academy platform, an interactive Python learning platform with real-time competitions, this was the reality. Every deployment meant 2-3 minutes of complete outage, even for the smallest UI tweak.

The culprit? A monolithic Docker Compose setup where every service was tightly coupled. Change the frontend? Restart the database. Update the backend? Restart everything. It was frustrating, inefficient, and frankly, unprofessional.

I decided it was time for a something different and more professional, even for a free test website. I migrated from a single `docker-compose.prod.yml` file orchestrating everything to a decoupled, three-tier architecture that enables true zero-downtime deployments on Coolify. The result? I can now deploy frontend changes without touching the database, update the backend independently, and keep the infrastructure services running 24/7 (almost 😂)

In this post, I'll walk you through our journey: the problems we faced, the architecture we designed, and how we implemented it. Whether you're running a similar setup or just curious about zero-downtime deployments, I hope this experience helps you avoid the pitfalls I encountered.

## The Problem: Monolithic Deployment Pain

Let me start by explaining what we had and why it was problematic.

### What is a Monolithic Deployment?

In our original setup, we had a single `docker-compose.prod.yml` file that defined all our services: PostgreSQL database, Redis cache, LibreTranslate translation service, our FastAPI backend, and our Next.js frontend. When Coolify detected a change (like a new commit to the repository), it would:

1. Stop all containers
    
2. Rebuild any changed services
    
3. Start all containers again
    
4. Wait for health checks to pass
    

This is what I call a "monolithic deployment"—everything is bundled together, and everything restarts together. It's simple to understand, but it comes with significant drawbacks.

### Real-World Impact

The real-world impact was brutal. Here's what happened during a typical deployment:

**Scenario 1: Frontend UI Fix**

* I push a small CSS fix to improve button styling
    
* Coolify detects the change and triggers a redeploy
    
* All services stop: database, Redis, backend, frontend
    
* Database restarts (unnecessary, but required by the monolith)
    
* Redis restarts (unnecessary)
    
* Backend restarts (unnecessary)
    
* Frontend rebuilds and restarts
    
* Total downtime: 3-4 minutes
    
* Users see "Service Unavailable" errors
    

**Scenario 2: Backend API Update**

* I add a new endpoint for user profiles
    
* Same process: everything stops, everything restarts
    
* Database connections are dropped mid-request
    
* Active user sessions are lost
    
* Total downtime: 4-5 minutes
    

**Scenario 3: Infrastructure Change**

* I need to update PostgreSQL configuration
    
* This is the only scenario where a full restart makes sense
    
* But even here, we're restarting the frontend unnecessarily
    

### Specific Pain Points

Let me break down the specific problems we faced:

**1\. Database Restarts on Frontend Changes** The most frustrating issue: updating a React component would cause our PostgreSQL database to restart. This made no sense—the database had nothing to do with the frontend change. But because everything was in one Docker Compose file, Coolify treated it as one unit.

**2\. Long Outage Windows** Our deployments took 2-5 minutes on average. During this time:

* Users couldn't log in
    
* Active sessions were lost
    
* API requests failed
    
* Real-time features (like our coding battles) disconnected
    

**3\. No Independent Updates** There was no way to update just the frontend or just the backend. Every change required a full platform restart. This slowed down our development cycle and made us hesitant to deploy small fixes.

**4\. Resource Waste** We were restarting services that didn't need to restart. PostgreSQL, Redis, and LibreTranslate are stable services that rarely change. Restarting them on every deployment was wasteful and risky.

**5\. Deployment Anxiety** Because every deployment meant downtime, we started batching changes. Instead of deploying small fixes immediately, we'd wait until we had multiple changes. This meant bugs stayed in production longer than necessary. Usually to led user play with the pygame, this meant night deployment 😩 Welcome back in the 80s

## Understanding the Architecture

Before diving into the solution, let me explain the architecture concepts we're working with. If you're already familiar with microservices and container orchestration, feel free to skip ahead. But I want to make sure everyone understands the "why" behind our decisions.

### The Three-Tier Architecture Concept

Instead of one monolithic deployment, we split our platform into three distinct layers, each with different characteristics and update frequencies:

1. **Infrastructure Layer**: Stable services that rarely change
    
2. **Backend Layer**: API application that changes moderately
    
3. **Frontend Layer**: User interface that changes frequently
    

This separation allows us to update each layer independently, which is the key to zero-downtime deployments.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1767126960965/8b793940-be47-4764-bac9-a01497dfbe07.png align="left")

### Layer 1: Infrastructure (The Stable Foundation)

The infrastructure layer contains services that form the foundation of our platform. These services are stable, well-tested, and rarely need updates.

**PostgreSQL Database**

* Stores all application data: users, challenges, submissions, battles
    
* Rarely changes: maybe a configuration tweak once a quarter
    
* Critical: if it goes down, the entire platform is unusable
    
* Resource-intensive: needs consistent memory and CPU
    

**Redis Cache**

* Handles session storage and leaderboard caching
    
* Ephemeral data: can be rebuilt if needed
    
* Fast: restarts quickly, but still unnecessary to restart on every deployment
    
* Lightweight: minimal resource usage
    

**LibreTranslate**

* Provides automatic translation for our international users
    
* Pre-loaded models: takes time to start up (60-120 seconds)
    
* Stable: we update it maybe once a year
    
* Resource-intensive: loads language models into memory
    

**Executor Builder**

* Builds the Docker image used for code execution
    
* Build-only service: creates an image but doesn't run as a container
    
* Critical for our code execution features
    
* Only needs to rebuild when we change security policies or execution environment
    

**Why These Rarely Change** These services are infrastructure—they're the foundation, not the application. Think of them like the foundation of a house: you don't rebuild the foundation when you repaint the walls. Similarly, we don't need to restart the database when we update the frontend.

### Layer 2: Backend (The Business Logic)

The backend layer contains our FastAPI application—the brain of our platform.

**FastAPI Application**

* Handles all API logic: authentication, challenge validation, battle management
    
* Changes frequently: new features, bug fixes, performance improvements
    
* Depends on Infrastructure: needs database and Redis to function
    
* Stateless: can be scaled horizontally (run multiple instances)
    

**Key Characteristics**

* Updates weekly or bi-weekly as we add features
    
* Needs to connect to database and Redis (via container names)
    
* Requires Docker socket access for code execution features
    
* Has health checks to ensure it's ready before accepting traffic
    

**Why It's Separate** The backend changes more frequently than infrastructure but less frequently than the frontend. By separating it, we can:

* Deploy backend updates without touching the database
    
* Scale backend independently
    
* Roll back backend changes without affecting infrastructure
    

### Layer 3: Frontend (The User Interface)

The frontend layer contains our Next.js application—what users see and interact with.

**Next.js Application**

* Serves the user interface: dashboards, challenge browser, battle arena
    
* Changes most frequently: UI improvements, bug fixes, new pages
    
* Depends on Backend: makes API calls to the backend
    
* Stateless: can be scaled horizontally
    

**Key Characteristics**

* Updates multiple times per week (sometimes daily)
    
* Only needs the backend API URL to function
    
* Builds at deployment time (static assets generated during Docker build)
    
* Has health checks to ensure it's serving pages correctly
    

**Why It's Separate** The frontend changes the most frequently. By separating it:

* We can deploy UI fixes instantly without database restarts
    
* Users see updates faster
    
* We can A/B test different frontend versions
    
* Frontend developers can deploy independently
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1767127421849/3559bee7-54d7-44d1-9152-a5a7903c32b4.png align="left")

### The Network: How Services Communicate

All three layers communicate over a shared Docker network called `cybercodeacademy-proxy`. This is crucial for the architecture to work.

**Container Name Resolution** Docker provides DNS-based service discovery. When services are on the same network, they can find each other by container name:

* Backend finds database at: `cybercodeacademy-db`
    
* Backend finds Redis at: `cybercodeacademy-redis`
    
* Backend finds translator at: `cybercodeacademy-translate`
    
* Frontend finds backend at: configured via environment variable (domain or internal DNS)
    

**Why This Matters** Instead of using `localhost` or IP addresses (which change), we use container names. Docker's internal DNS resolves these names to the correct container IPs, even when containers restart or move to different hosts.

**External Network** The `cybercodeacademy-proxy` network is marked as `external: true`, meaning it exists outside of any single Docker Compose file. This allows:

* Infrastructure services (from `docker-compose.infra.yaml`) to join the network
    
* Backend service (from Coolify) to join the network
    
* Frontend service (from Coolify) to join the network
    
* All services to communicate with each other
    

This is the glue that holds our decoupled architecture together.

## The Solution: Decoupled Architecture

Now that we understand the architecture, let's dive into how we implemented it. The migration involved three main changes: restructuring our files, configuring Coolify resources, and setting up the network.

### Breaking Down the Monolith

The first step was to split our single `docker-compose.prod.yml` into separate, focused files.

#### File Structure Changes

**Before:**

```plaintext
cyber-code-academy/
├── docker-compose.prod.yml    ← Everything in one file
├── backend/
│   └── Dockerfile
└── frontend/
    └── Dockerfile
```

**After:**

```plaintext
cyber-code-academy/
├── docker-compose.infra.yaml  ← Infrastructure only
├── docker-compose.dev.yml      ← Local development (full stack)
├── docker-compose.prod.yml     ← DEPRECATED (kept for reference)
├── backend/
│   └── Dockerfile              ← Standalone backend image
└── frontend/
    └── Dockerfile              ← Standalone frontend image
```

**docker-compose.infra.yaml** This file contains only the infrastructure services:

* PostgreSQL (`cybercodeacademy-db`)
    
* Redis (`cybercodeacademy-redis`)
    
* LibreTranslate (`cybercodeacademy-translate`)
    
* Executor Builder (builds the executor image)
    

Here's a simplified version of what it looks like:

```yaml
services:
  app-db:
    image: postgres:15-alpine
    container_name: my-db
    restart: always
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: ${POSTGRES_USER}
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
      POSTGRES_DB: ${POSTGRES_DB}
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    networks:
      - cybercodeacademy-proxy
    # ... health checks, resource limits, etc.

  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    container_name: my-redis
    restart: always
    networks:
      - cybercodeacademy-proxy
    # ... configuration

  libretranslate:
    image: libretranslate/libretranslate:latest
    container_name: my-translate
    restart: always
    networks:
      - cybercodeacademy-proxy
    # ... configuration

networks:
  cybercodeacademy-proxy:
    external: true
    name: ${PROXY_NETWORK:-coolify}
```

Notice that:

* All services use the same external network
    
* Container names are explicit (for DNS resolution)
    
* No backend or frontend services—those are deployed separately
    

**Backend Dockerfile** The backend Dockerfile remains mostly the same, but we ensure it works with different build contexts:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.13-slim

# Build context can be repository root (.) or backend directory (/backend)
ARG SOURCE_PATH=backend/
ARG REQUIREMENTS_PATH=backend/

WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies
COPY ${REQUIREMENTS_PATH}requirements.txt ./requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy application code
COPY --chown=appuser:appgroup ${SOURCE_PATH} /app/

# Health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=10s --retries=3 \
    CMD curl -f http://localhost:8000/ || exit 1

# Start application
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

**Frontend Dockerfile** The frontend uses a multi-stage build for optimization:

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Dependencies
FROM node:20-alpine AS deps
WORKDIR /app
COPY frontend/package.json frontend/pnpm-lock.yaml* ./
RUN corepack enable pnpm && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

# Stage 2: Builder
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY frontend/ .
ENV NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=${PUBLIC_API_URL}
RUN pnpm build

# Stage 3: Runner
FROM node:20-alpine AS runner
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/.next/standalone ./
COPY --from=builder /app/.next/static ./.next/static
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

The key point: both Dockerfiles are designed to work independently, without requiring a full Docker Compose orchestration.

### Coolify Configuration

The magic happens in Coolify, where we configure three separate resources.

#### Resource 1: Infrastructure (Docker Compose)

**Type**: Docker Compose **Purpose**: Deploy stable infrastructure services **File**: `docker-compose.infra.yaml`

**Configuration Steps**:

1. Create a new Coolify resource
    
2. Select "Docker Compose" as the type
    
3. Upload `docker-compose.infra.yaml`
    
4. Set environment variables:
    
    ```plaintext
    POSTGRES_USER=pguser
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<strong-password>
    POSTGRES_DB=my-db
    PROXY_NETWORK=cybercodeacademy-proxy
    EXECUTOR_IMAGE_NAME=my-executor
    ```
    
5. Configure the external network: `cybercodeacademy-proxy`
    
6. Deploy
    

**Key Points**:

* This resource deploys once and rarely updates
    
* All infrastructure services run here
    
* The executor image is built automatically
    
* Network is external, shared with other resources
    

#### Resource 2: Backend (Public Repository)

**Type**: Public Repository **Purpose**: Deploy the FastAPI backend independently **Repository**: `mmornati/cyber-code-academy`**Dockerfile**: `backend/Dockerfile`**Build Context**: `/backend` (backend directory)

**Configuration Steps**:

1. Create a new Coolify resource
    
2. Select "Public Repository"
    
3. Connect GitHub repository: `mmornati/cyber-code-academy`
    
4. Set Dockerfile path: `backend/Dockerfile`
    
5. Set build context: `/backend`
    
6. Enable auto-redeploy on commits
    
7. Configure external network: `cybercodeacademy-proxy`
    
8. Set environment variables:
    
    ```plaintext
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://pguser:<password>@mydb-db:5432/mydb
    REDIS_URL=redis://my-redis:6379
    JWT_SECRET=<secret>
    JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=<refresh-secret>
    ENVIRONMENT=production
    EXECUTOR_IMAGE_NAME=my-executor
    DOCKER_HOST=unix:///var/run/docker.sock
    LIBRETRANSLATE_URL=http://my-translate:5000
    # ... other variables
    ```
    
9. Deploy
    

**Key Points**:

* Database URL uses container name (`cybercodeacademy-db`), not `localhost`
    
* Redis URL uses container name (`cybercodeacademy-redis`)
    
* Backend can start without executor image (it will build it if missing)
    
* Health check: `/` endpoint must return 200 OK
    

#### Resource 3: Frontend (Public Repository)

**Type**: Public Repository **Purpose**: Deploy the Next.js frontend independently **Repository**: `mmornati/cyber-code-academy`**Dockerfile**: `frontend/Dockerfile`**Build Context**: `/` (repository root)

**Configuration Steps**:

1. Create a new Coolify resource
    
2. Select "Public Repository"
    
3. Connect GitHub repository: `mmornati/cyber-code-academy`
    
4. Set Dockerfile path: `frontend/Dockerfile`
    
5. Set build context: `/` (repository root)
    
6. Enable auto-redeploy on commits
    
7. Configure external network: `cybercodeacademy-proxy`
    
8. Set environment variables:
    
    ```plaintext
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com
    NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com
    NODE_ENV=production
    ```
    
9. Configure Traefik routing (if using Coolify's Traefik)
    
10. Deploy
    

**Key Points**:

* Build context is repository root (needed for multi-stage build)
    
* API URL points to backend's public domain
    
* Frontend waits for backend to be healthy before starting
    
* Health check: `GET /` endpoint must return 200 OK

### Network Architecture Deep Dive

The network is the critical piece that makes everything work. Let me explain how we set it up.

**Creating the External Network**

First, we create the external network on the Coolify server:

```bash
docker network create cybercodeacademy-proxy
```

This network exists independently of any Docker Compose file or Coolify resource. It's persistent and shared.

**Connecting Services**

Each service connects to this network:

**Infrastructure (docker-compose.infra.yaml)**:

```yaml
networks:
  cybercodeacademy-proxy:
    external: true
    name: ${PROXY_NETWORK:-coolify}
```

**Backend (Coolify resource)**:

* In Coolify's network configuration, select "External Network"
    
* Enter network name: `cybercodeacademy-proxy`
    

**Frontend (Coolify resource)**:

* Same as backend: select "External Network"
    
* Enter network name: `cybercodeacademy-proxy`
    

**Container Name Resolution**

Once services are on the same network, Docker's built-in DNS resolves container names to IP addresses:

* `cybercodeacademy-db` → PostgreSQL container IP
    
* `cybercodeacademy-redis` → Redis container IP
    
* `cybercodeacademy-translate` → LibreTranslate container IP
    
* `cybercodeacademy-api` → Backend container IP (if you need it)
    

This is why we use container names in connection strings instead of `localhost` or IP addresses.

**Why External Networks Matter**

External networks allow:

* Services from different Docker Compose files to communicate
    
* Services deployed by different Coolify resources to communicate
    
* Services to find each other even after restarts (IPs change, names don't)
    
* Independent deployment without breaking connections
    

Without external networks, each Docker Compose file or Coolify resource would create its own isolated network, and services couldn't communicate across resources.

## Zero-Downtime Deployment: How It Works

Now for the exciting part: how we achieve zero-downtime deployments. The key is Coolify's "Start-before-Stop" strategy combined with health checks.

### Understanding Start-before-Stop

Traditional deployments follow a "Stop-then-Start" pattern:

1. Stop old container
    
2. Build new container
    
3. Start new container
    
4. Wait for health checks
    
5. **Result**: Downtime during steps 1-4
    

Start-before-Stop reverses this:

1. Build new container (in parallel with old one running)
    
2. Start new container
    
3. Wait for health checks to pass
    
4. Switch traffic to new container
    
5. Stop old container
    
6. **Result**: Zero downtime (old container serves traffic until new one is ready)
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1767128344977/966d2215-1ee8-49d1-be5f-17ee7bb5bb8b.jpeg align="left")

### Backend Update Process

Let's walk through what happens when we update the backend:

**Step 1: Coolify Detects Change**

* We push a commit to the `main` branch
    
* Coolify's webhook triggers a new deployment
    
* Coolify starts building the new backend container
    
* **Old backend container continues serving traffic** ✅
    

**Step 2: New Container Starts**

* New container is built with the latest code
    
* New container starts on the `cybercodeacademy-proxy` network
    
* New container can see infrastructure services (database, Redis)
    
* New container begins initialization
    
* **Old backend container still serving traffic** ✅
    

**Step 3: Health Checks**

* New container runs its health check: `curl -f http://localhost:8000/`
    
* Health check passes (container is ready)
    
* New container is marked as "healthy"
    
* **Old backend container still serving traffic** ✅
    

**Step 4: Traffic Switch**

* Coolify's load balancer (Traefik) switches traffic to the new container
    
* New container starts receiving requests
    
* Old container stops receiving new requests
    
* **No downtime** ✅
    

**Step 5: Old Container Stops**

* Old container is gracefully stopped
    
* Connections are closed
    
* Old container is removed
    
* **New container continues serving traffic** ✅
    

**Total Downtime**: 0 seconds

### Frontend Update Process

The frontend follows the same pattern:

**Step 1: Build New Frontend**

* Coolify builds new Next.js container
    
* Build includes static asset generation
    
* **Old frontend still serving pages** ✅
    

**Step 2: Start New Container**

* New frontend container starts
    
* Health check: `wget --spider http://localhost:3000/`
    
* **Old frontend still serving pages** ✅
    

**Step 3: Traffic Switch**

* Traefik switches traffic to new frontend
    
* Users see new version immediately
    
* **No downtime** ✅
    

**Step 4: Stop Old Container**

* Old container stops
    
* **New container continues serving** ✅
    

**Total Downtime**: 0 seconds

### Infrastructure Stability

The beautiful part: infrastructure services never restart during backend or frontend deployments.

**During Backend Update**:

* PostgreSQL: Running ✅
    
* Redis: Running ✅
    
* LibreTranslate: Running ✅
    
* Backend: Old → New (zero downtime) ✅
    

**During Frontend Update**:

* PostgreSQL: Running ✅
    
* Redis: Running ✅
    
* LibreTranslate: Running ✅
    
* Backend: Running ✅
    
* Frontend: Old → New (zero downtime) ✅
    

**When Infrastructure Updates** (rare):

* Only infrastructure services restart
    
* Backend and frontend continue running (they reconnect automatically)
    
* Minimal impact (infrastructure updates are infrequent)
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1767128449520/7d65422f-2588-4a7d-b2f0-2f3d56068958.jpeg align="left")

### Why Health Checks Are Critical

Health checks are what make zero-downtime deployments possible. Without them, Coolify can't know when a container is ready to accept traffic.

**Backend Health Check**:

```dockerfile
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=10s --retries=3 \
    CMD curl -f http://localhost:8000/ || exit 1
```

This checks:

* Container is running
    
* Application has started
    
* Application is responding to HTTP requests
    
* Database connections are working (implicitly, since the app won't start without DB)
    

**Frontend Health Check**:

```dockerfile
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
    CMD wget --no-verbose --tries=1 --spider http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/health || exit 1
```

This checks:

* Container is running
    
* Next.js server has started
    
* Pages are being served correctly
    

**What Happens If Health Checks Fail**

If health checks fail, Coolify won't switch traffic to the new container. The old container continues serving traffic, and you get a deployment failure notification. This is a safety mechanism—better to have a failed deployment than to serve broken code.

---

## Implementation Details

Now let's get into the nitty-gritty of how we set everything up. I'll walk you through each phase of the deployment process.

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Deployment

The infrastructure layer is the foundation, so we deploy it first.

#### Setting Up the Docker Compose Resource

In Coolify:

1. Navigate to "Resources"
    
2. Click "New Resource"
    
3. Select "Docker Compose"
    
4. Name it: "Infrastructure" or "Database Stack"
    

#### Uploading the Compose File

1. Upload `docker-compose.infra.yaml`
    
2. Coolify will parse the file and show all services
    
3. Verify that all services are detected:
    
    * `app-db` (PostgreSQL)
        
    * `redis` (Redis)
        
    * `libretranslate` (LibreTranslate)
        
    * `executor-builder` (Executor image builder)
        

#### Environment Variables

Set these in Coolify's environment variable section:

```plaintext
POSTGRES_USER=pguser
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<generate-strong-password>
POSTGRES_DB=my-db
PROXY_NETWORK=cybercodeacademy-proxy
EXECUTOR_IMAGE_NAME=my-executor
```

**Security Note**: Use a strong password for PostgreSQL. Generate one with:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

#### Network Configuration

**Critical Step**: Before deploying, create the external network:

```bash
# SSH into your Coolify server
docker network create cybercodeacademy-proxy
```

Then, in Coolify's network settings for this resource:

* Select "External Network"
    
* Enter: `cybercodeacademy-proxy`
    

#### Volume Management

The infrastructure uses Docker volumes for persistent data:

* `postgres_data`: PostgreSQL database files
    
* `redis_data`: Redis data (optional, Redis can be ephemeral)
    

**Migration Consideration**: If you're migrating from the old monolithic setup, you may need to reuse existing volumes. Check your old volumes:

```bash
docker volume ls | grep postgres
docker volume ls | grep redis
```

If you have existing volumes, you can reference them in `docker-compose.infra.yaml`:

```yaml
volumes:
  postgres_data:
    external: true
    name: <existing-volume-name>
```

#### Deploying

1. Click "Deploy" in Coolify
    
2. Watch the logs to ensure all services start correctly
    
3. Verify health checks pass:
    
    * PostgreSQL: `pg_isready` should succeed
        
    * Redis: `redis-cli ping` should return `PONG`
        
    * LibreTranslate: HTTP check should succeed (may take 60-120 seconds)
        

#### Verifying the Executor Image

After deployment, verify the executor image was built:

```bash
docker images | grep my-executor
```

You should see: `my-executor:latest`

If it's missing, the backend will build it automatically on startup, but it's better to have it pre-built.

### Phase 2: Backend Deployment

Once infrastructure is running, we deploy the backend.

#### Creating the Repository Resource

In Coolify:

1. Navigate to "Resources"
    
2. Click "New Resource"
    
3. Select "Public Repository"
    
4. Name it: "Backend API" or "FastAPI Backend"
    

#### Connecting GitHub

1. Click "Connect Repository"
    
2. Authorize Coolify to access your GitHub account
    
3. Select repository: `mmornati/cyber-code-academy`
    
4. Select branch: `main` (or your production branch)
    

#### Dockerfile Configuration

**Dockerfile Path**: `backend/Dockerfile`

**Build Context**: `/backend`

**Why** `/backend`? The backend Dockerfile uses build arguments to handle different contexts:

* Development: context is repository root (`.`), so it uses `backend/` prefix
    
* Production: context is `/backend`, so it uses empty prefix (`.`)
    

This allows the same Dockerfile to work in both scenarios.

#### Environment Variables

Set these environment variables in Coolify:

```plaintext
# Database Connection (uses container name, not localhost!)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://pguser:<password>@my-db:5432/my-db

# Redis Connection (uses container name)
REDIS_URL=redis://cybercodeacadem-redis:6379

# JWT Secrets (generate strong secrets)
JWT_SECRET=<generate-strong-secret>
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=<generate-strong-secret>

# Application Settings
ENVIRONMENT=production
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@cybercodeacademy.dev
ADMIN_PASSWORD=<secure-password>

# Executor Configuration
EXECUTOR_IMAGE_NAME=my-executor
EXECUTOR_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=10
EXECUTOR_MEMORY_LIMIT=512m
EXECUTOR_CPU_LIMIT=1.0
EXECUTOR_MAX_POOL_SIZE=5

# Docker Socket (for executor container management)
DOCKER_HOST=unix:///var/run/docker.sock

# AI Provider
AI_PROVIDER=google
GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY=<your-google-ai-key>

# Translation Service (uses container name)
LIBRETRANSLATE_URL=http://my-translate:5000
```

**Critical Points**:

* `DATABASE_URL` uses `cybercodeacadem-db` (container name), not `localhost` or an IP
    
* `REDIS_URL` uses `cybercodeacadem-redis` (container name)
    
* `LIBRETRANSLATE_URL` uses `cybercodeacadem-translate` (container name)
    
* All secrets should be strong and unique
    

#### Network Configuration

1. In Coolify's network settings for the backend resource
    
2. Select "External Network"
    
3. Enter: `cybercodeacadem-proxy`
    

This connects the backend to the same network as infrastructure services.

#### Docker Socket Access

The backend needs access to the Docker socket to manage executor containers. In Coolify:

1. Enable "Docker Socket" or "Privileged Mode"
    
2. This mounts `/var/run/docker.sock` into the container
    
3. Allows the backend to create/stop executor containers for code execution
    

**Security Note**: Docker socket access is powerful. Ensure your backend code is secure and doesn't allow arbitrary container creation.

#### Auto-Redeploy Configuration

Enable auto-redeploy:

1. In Coolify, go to the backend resource settings
    
2. Enable "Auto Deploy on Push"
    
3. Select the branch: `main` (or your production branch)
    
4. Coolify will automatically deploy when you push to this branch
    

#### Health Check Configuration

Coolify will use the health check defined in the Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=10s --retries=3 \
    CMD curl -f http://localhost:8000/ || exit 1
```

Ensure your backend has a root endpoint (`/`) that returns 200 OK. This is what the health check calls.

#### Deploying

1. Click "Deploy" in Coolify
    
2. Watch the build logs
    
3. Once built, the container starts
    
4. Health checks run
    
5. Once healthy, the backend is ready
    

#### Verifying Backend Connectivity

After deployment, verify the backend can connect to infrastructure:

```bash
# Check backend logs
docker logs cybercodeacadem-api

# Look for:
# - "Connected to database"
# - "Redis connection established"
# - "Application startup complete"
```

If you see connection errors, check:

* Network configuration (all services on same network?)
    
* Container names (match exactly?)
    
* Environment variables (correct passwords/secrets?)
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1767128984961/baa994d1-05f7-4d35-9acf-6b0d777d10a4.jpeg align="left")

### Phase 3: Frontend Deployment

Finally, we deploy the frontend.

#### Creating the Repository Resource

1. Navigate to "Resources"
    
2. Click "New Resource"
    
3. Select "Public Repository"
    
4. Name it: "Frontend Web" or "Next.js Frontend"
    

#### Connecting GitHub

Same as backend:

1. Connect repository: `mmornati/cyber-code-academy`
    
2. Select branch: `main`
    

#### Dockerfile Configuration

**Dockerfile Path**: `frontend/Dockerfile`

**Build Context**: `/` (repository root)

**Why repository root?** The frontend Dockerfile needs access to:

* `frontend/` directory (source code)
    
* `user-docs/` directory (documentation to build)
    
* Root-level files if needed
    

Using repository root as build context allows the Dockerfile to copy from multiple directories.

#### Environment Variables

Set these in Coolify:

```plaintext
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com
NODE_ENV=production
```

**Important**:

* `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables are embedded at **build time**, not runtime
    
* They must be set before building the Docker image
    
* If you change them, you must rebuild the frontend
    

**API URL Options**:

* **Public Domain**: `https://api.yourdomain.com` (if backend has public domain)
    
* **Internal DNS**: `http://my-api:8000` (if using internal network, but this won't work for browser requests)
    
* **Coolify Proxy**: Use Coolify's internal proxy if configured
    

For browser requests, you typically need a public domain. The frontend runs in the user's browser, so it can't use Docker's internal DNS.

#### Network Configuration

1. Select "External Network"
    
2. Enter: `cybercodeacadem-proxy`
    

Even though the frontend doesn't directly connect to infrastructure services, being on the same network can be useful for:

* Health checks
    
* Internal monitoring
    
* Future features that might need direct access
    

#### Traefik Routing (Optional)

If using Coolify's Traefik for routing:

1. Enable "Traefik" in frontend resource settings
    
2. Set domain: `yourdomain.com`
    
3. Traefik will automatically:
    
    * Generate SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt)
        
    * Route traffic to the frontend container
        
    * Handle load balancing
        

#### Health Check

The frontend health check:

```dockerfile
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
    CMD wget --no-verbose --tries=1 --spider http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/health || exit 1
```

Ensure your Next.js app has a `/api/health` endpoint that returns 200 OK.

#### Deploying

1. Click "Deploy"
    
2. Build process may take 5-10 minutes (Next.js builds can be slow)
    
3. Once built, container starts
    
4. Health checks run
    
5. Frontend is ready
    

#### Verifying Frontend Connectivity

After deployment:

1. Open your domain in a browser
    
2. Check browser console for API errors
    
3. Verify frontend can reach backend API
    
4. Test a few key features (login, challenge loading, etc.)
    

### Key Configuration Details

Let me cover some important configuration details that apply to all services.

#### Container Naming Conventions

We use explicit container names for DNS resolution:

* `cybercodeacadem-db` (PostgreSQL)
    
* `cybercodeacadem-redis` (Redis)
    
* `cybercodeacadem-translate` (LibreTranslate)
    
* `cybercodeacadem-api` (Backend)
    
* `cybercodeacadem-web` (Frontend)
    

**Why explicit names?**

* Predictable DNS resolution
    
* Easy to reference in connection strings
    
* Consistent across deployments
    
* No dependency on Docker Compose service names
    

#### Health Check Strategies

**Infrastructure Services**:

* PostgreSQL: `pg_isready` command
    
* Redis: `redis-cli ping`
    
* LibreTranslate: HTTP request to `/`
    

**Application Services**:

* Backend: HTTP GET to `/`
    
* Frontend: HTTP GET to `/api/health`
    

**Best Practices**:

* Health checks should be lightweight (fast)
    
* They should verify the service is actually working, not just running
    
* Use appropriate intervals (30s is good for most services)
    
* Set reasonable timeouts (10s is usually enough)
    

#### Resource Limits

We set resource limits to prevent any single service from consuming all resources:

**PostgreSQL**:

```yaml
deploy:
  resources:
    limits:
      memory: 512M
    reservations:
      memory: 256M
```

**Redis**:

```yaml
deploy:
  resources:
    limits:
      memory: 256M
    reservations:
      memory: 64M
```

**Backend**:

* Memory limit: 1G
    
* CPU limit: 2.0 (if needed)
    

**Frontend**:

* Memory limit: 512M
    
* CPU limit: 1.0 (if needed)
    

These limits ensure fair resource allocation and prevent one service from starving others.

## Benefits & Results

Now that we've covered the implementation, let's talk about the results. The migration has transformed how we deploy and operate our platform.

### Operational Benefits

**Zero-Downtime Deployments** The most obvious benefit: we can now deploy without any user-visible downtime. Frontend updates, backend updates, and even some infrastructure changes happen seamlessly. Users never see "Service Unavailable" errors during deployments.

**Before**: 3-5 minutes of downtime per deployment **After**: 0 seconds of downtime

**Independent Scaling** We can scale services independently based on their needs:

* Frontend: Scale up during peak traffic (more users browsing)
    
* Backend: Scale up during battle events (more API calls)
    
* Infrastructure: Keep stable (rarely needs scaling)
    

This wasn't possible with the monolithic setup—we had to scale everything together.

**Faster Iteration Cycles** Because deployments are risk-free (no downtime), we deploy more frequently:

* **Before**: 1-2 deployments per week (batched changes)
    
* **After**: 5-10 deployments per week (deploy as soon as code is ready)
    

This means:

* Bugs are fixed faster
    
* Features reach users sooner
    
* We can experiment with confidence
    

**Better Resource Utilization** We're no longer wasting resources restarting services that don't need to restart:

* Database stays running (saves 30-60 seconds per deployment)
    
* Redis stays running (saves 10-20 seconds)
    
* LibreTranslate stays running (saves 60-120 seconds)
    

Over a month, this adds up to significant time and resource savings.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1767129108337/3da8e31e-59af-405a-a860-89914f439c0a.jpeg align="left")

### Developer Experience

**Deploy Frontend Without Touching Database** This is the game-changer. Frontend developers can now deploy UI changes without worrying about database restarts. A CSS fix? Deploy in 2 minutes, zero impact on backend or database.

**Quick Rollbacks** If a deployment goes wrong, we can roll back just the affected service:

* Frontend broken? Roll back frontend only (30 seconds)
    
* Backend broken? Roll back backend only (1 minute)
    
* Infrastructure issue? Rare, but can be addressed independently
    

With the monolithic setup, any rollback required restarting everything (5+ minutes).

**Parallel Development** Different teams can work on different services without blocking each other:

* Frontend team deploys UI improvements
    
* Backend team deploys API changes
    
* Both happen simultaneously, no conflicts
    

**Confidence in Deployments** Knowing that deployments won't cause downtime gives us confidence to:

* Deploy on Fridays (no more "no deployments on Fridays" rule)
    
* Deploy during business hours (users won't notice)
    
* Experiment with new features (easy to roll back if needed)
    

### Cost & Performance

**Reduced Unnecessary Restarts** Every unnecessary restart consumes:

* CPU cycles (container initialization)
    
* Memory (loading services into RAM)
    
* I/O bandwidth (reading files, connecting to databases)
    
* Time (waiting for services to start)
    

By eliminating unnecessary restarts, we:

* Reduce server load
    
* Lower resource costs
    
* Improve overall system stability
    

**Better Resource Allocation** With independent services, we can:

* Allocate more resources to services that need them
    
* Scale down services that don't need resources
    
* Optimize each service independently
    

For example:

* Frontend: Lightweight, can run on smaller instances
    
* Backend: More CPU-intensive, needs more resources
    
* Database: Memory-intensive, needs dedicated resources
    

**Improved Reliability** The decoupled architecture is more resilient:

* If frontend fails, backend and database keep running
    
* If backend fails, database keeps running (data is safe)
    
* If one service has issues, others are unaffected
    

This isolation prevents cascading failures.

### Real-World Example

Let me share a real example from our platform:

**Scenario**: We discovered a UI bug where the challenge browser wasn't showing difficulty badges correctly. It was a simple CSS issue—one line of code.

**Before (Monolithic)**:

1. Fix the CSS (5 minutes)
    
2. Wait until low-traffic period (2 hours later)
    
3. Deploy (triggers full restart)
    
4. 4 minutes of downtime
    
5. Users see "Service Unavailable"
    
6. Total time: 2+ hours, 4 minutes of downtime
    

**After (Decoupled)**:

1. Fix the CSS (5 minutes)
    
2. Push to `main` branch
    
3. Coolify auto-deploys frontend (2 minutes)
    
4. Zero downtime
    
5. Users see the fix immediately
    
6. Total time: 7 minutes, 0 seconds of downtime
    

This is the difference decoupling makes.

## Lessons Learned & Best Practices

After going through this migration, I've learned a lot. Here are the key lessons and best practices I'd recommend to anyone considering a similar migration.

### What Worked Well

**1\. External Networks Are Your Friend** Using an external network (`cybercodeacadem-proxy`) was the key to making everything work. It allows services from different Coolify resources to communicate seamlessly. Without it, we'd be stuck with complex networking workarounds.

**2\. Container Names for DNS** Using explicit container names (`cybercodeacadem-db`, `cybercodeacadem-redis`) instead of service names or IPs made connection strings predictable and reliable. Docker's DNS resolution is rock-solid when you use container names.

**3\. Health Checks Are Non-Negotiable** Health checks are what make zero-downtime deployments possible. Without them, Coolify can't know when a container is ready. Invest time in getting health checks right—they're worth it.

**4\. Build Context Matters** Understanding Docker build contexts was crucial. The backend uses `/backend` as context, while the frontend uses `/` (repository root). Getting this wrong causes confusing build errors.

**5\. Gradual Migration** We didn't migrate everything at once. We:

1. Set up infrastructure first
    
2. Migrated backend second
    
3. Migrated frontend last
    

This gradual approach let us test each piece independently and catch issues early.

### Challenges Encountered

**1\. Network Configuration Confusion** Initially, we had issues with services not finding each other. The problem: we were mixing `localhost`, IP addresses, and container names. The solution: use container names consistently, and ensure all services are on the same external network.

**2\. Environment Variable Timing** Frontend environment variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_*`) are embedded at build time, not runtime. We learned this the hard way when changing API URLs didn't work until we rebuilt the image. The lesson: set environment variables before building, not after.

**3\. Volume Migration** Migrating existing PostgreSQL and Redis volumes was tricky. We had to:

* Identify existing volumes
    
* Reference them in the new compose file
    
* Ensure permissions were correct
    

For new deployments, this isn't an issue, but for migrations, it's something to plan for.

**4\. Executor Image Building** The executor image builder service in `docker-compose.infra.yaml` doesn't run as a container—it only builds the image. Coolify initially didn't build it automatically. We worked around this by having the backend build it on startup if missing, but it's better to pre-build it.

**5\. Health Check Endpoints** Not all services had proper health check endpoints initially. We had to add:

* Backend: `/` endpoint that returns 200 OK
    
* Frontend: `/api/health` endpoint
    

This is easy to fix, but it's something to plan for.

### Recommendations for Others

**When to Use This Pattern**

This decoupled architecture pattern is ideal when:

* ✅ You have services with different update frequencies (stable infrastructure, frequently-changing applications)
    
* ✅ You need zero-downtime deployments
    
* ✅ You're using a platform like Coolify that supports independent resource deployment
    
* ✅ You have a monorepo with multiple applications
    
* ✅ You want to scale services independently
    

**When NOT to Use This Pattern**

This pattern might be overkill if:

* ❌ You have a simple single-application setup
    
* ❌ All your services change together (true monolith)
    
* ❌ You don't have deployment downtime issues
    
* ❌ Your deployment platform doesn't support independent resources
    

**Network Configuration Tips**

1. **Create the external network first**: Before deploying anything, create the network:
    
    ```bash
    docker network create <network-name>
    ```
    
2. **Use consistent naming**: Use the same network name across all resources. We use `cybercodeacademy-proxy` everywhere.
    
3. **Verify network connectivity**: After deploying, verify services can reach each other:
    
    ```bash
    docker exec -it <container-name> ping <other-container-name>
    ```
    
4. **Document container names**: Keep a list of container names and what they're used for. This helps when configuring connection strings.
    

**Health Check Best Practices**

1. **Make health checks meaningful**: Don't just check if the process is running—check if the service is actually working. For example:
    
    * Database: Can it accept connections?
        
    * Backend: Can it respond to HTTP requests?
        
    * Frontend: Can it serve pages?
        
2. **Set appropriate intervals**:
    
    * Fast services (Redis): 10s interval
        
    * Medium services (Backend): 30s interval
        
    * Slow services (LibreTranslate): 30s interval with longer start period
        
3. **Use timeouts wisely**: Health checks should fail fast if the service is broken, but give enough time for slow-starting services.
    
4. **Test health checks locally**: Before deploying, test health checks in your local environment to ensure they work correctly.
    

**Volume Management Considerations**

1. **Plan for volume migration**: If you're migrating from a monolithic setup, identify existing volumes and plan how to reference them.
    
2. **Use named volumes**: Named volumes are easier to manage than anonymous volumes. They're also easier to backup and migrate.
    
3. **Backup before migration**: Always backup volumes before making changes. PostgreSQL and Redis data is critical—don't risk losing it.
    
4. **Consider volume drivers**: For production, consider using volume drivers (like NFS or cloud storage) for better reliability and portability.
    

**General Best Practices**

1. **Start with infrastructure**: Deploy infrastructure services first. They're the foundation, and other services depend on them.
    
2. **Test each layer independently**: Don't deploy everything at once. Test each layer (infrastructure, backend, frontend) independently before moving to the next.
    
3. **Monitor during migration**: Watch logs, metrics, and health checks during migration. Catch issues early.
    
4. **Have a rollback plan**: Know how to roll back each service independently. Practice rollbacks in a staging environment.
    
5. **Document everything**: Document container names, network names, environment variables, and connection strings. This helps when troubleshooting and onboarding new team members.
    
6. **Use version control**: Keep all configuration files (Dockerfiles, docker-compose files) in version control. This makes it easy to track changes and roll back if needed.

## Conclusion

Migrating from a monolithic Docker Compose deployment to a decoupled, three-tier architecture was one of the best decisions we made for Cyber Code Academy. The benefits are clear: zero-downtime deployments, independent scaling, faster iteration, and better resource utilization.

The journey wasn't without challenges—network configuration, health checks, and volume migration required careful planning. But the result is a deployment system that's robust, flexible, and professional.

If you're facing similar deployment pain, I encourage you to consider this approach. Start small: separate your infrastructure from your applications. Then, as you gain confidence, further decouple your services. The investment in time and effort pays off in reduced downtime, faster deployments, and happier users.

The key takeaway: **deployment architecture matters**. A well-designed deployment system enables rapid iteration, confident releases, and reliable operations. Don't let a monolithic deployment hold you back.

For us, this migration was transformative. We went from dreading deployments to deploying with confidence multiple times per week. Our users never see downtime, our developers can iterate quickly, and our platform is more resilient than ever.

If you're interested in seeing the actual configuration files or have questions about the migration, check out our repository or reach out. I'm happy to share more details about our setup.

Here's to zero-downtime deployments! 🚀
