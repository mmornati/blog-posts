# KermIT: Dynamic Groups for resources

A new interesting feature we are actually coding in KermIT web application isÂ <strong>Dynamic Groups</strong>. You can define a rule to group servers (and later, all kind of resources) and will be automatically added to this group if they match the rule. In this way, any new server added (or removed) to KermIT network will appear (or disappear) in the correct group with no manual interaction for the admin user.

In the video you can see how you can create dynamic groups and how servers are added to a group (with a simple refresh operation) but, as I said, this function is still in development and you can actually create dynamic groups based on faster facts.

Stay tuned for news about this cool feature! :D
