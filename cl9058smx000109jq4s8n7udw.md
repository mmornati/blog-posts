New Galaxy Note 2... and once again the auto update does not work (OTA or Kies) :S

Some weeks ago here in France (but I suppose today is everywhere), Samsung rolled out the [new Android 4.4.2 for the Galaxy Note 2 GSM](http://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-note-2-kitkat-update-android-4-4-2-372972/) (N7100) devices. If you have problem updating and/or checking for updates always return "Your device has the latest version installed" you can update it using [Odin](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1738841) or [Heimdall](http://glassechidna.com.au/heimdall/). 
The first one is simpler to use, but not available on Mac/Linux... or better... today there is [jOdin](https://builds.casual-dev.com/jodin3/), a Java version of Odin that works on any system. I tested it on my MacBook and, even if the devices was correctly detected, I wasn't able to update it... and I thought it was dangerous to update with a tool which works strangely.

To update your Galaxy Note 2 using Heimdall you can procede as following:

* [Download the firmware](http://www.phonandroid.com/forum/galaxy-note-2-n7100-roms-officielles-et-custom-f487.html) you want to install (the latest available for French phone is the **N7100XXUFND3 XEF**)
* Install Heimdall (if you don't have it).
* Check if your phone is correctly recognized:

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-user="marco" data-host="notebook"><code class="language-bash">sudo heimdall detect</code></pre>

* Download the PIT file (partition table of your phone):

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-user="marco" data-host="notebook"><code class="language-bash">sudo heimdall download-pit --output /tmp/note2.pit --no-reboot</code></pre>

* Extract the tar.md5 file (rename it to tar.gz if you have problem)

* Push all the ROM's files on your device via heimdall:

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-user="marco" data-host="notebook"><code class="language-bash">heimdall flash --pit /tmp/note2.pit --verbose --SYSTEM system.img --BOOT boot.img --RECOVERY recovery.img --CACHE cache.img --HIDDEN hidden.img --RADIO modem.bin --TZSW tz.img --BOOTLOADER sboot.bin</code></pre>

Wait 5/10 minutes (you can see the progress operation in heimdall) and your telephone should automatically reboot.

>**NOTE**: This procedure does **not** increment the Mod ROM Counter nor the Knox Flag. It's an update like the Kies one.

> **NOTE**: With this procedure you do **not** lose your data.

What's new?
--------

* Smoother interface: even if the pin pad (to unlock your phone) it is smaller then before and sometime difficult to use

* Faster performance: I don't have enought
* White status bar icons: I prefer the colored icons
* Full-screen album art and a camera shortcurt on the lock screen: I think this is the reason behind the smaller pin pad
* Wireless printing and NFC tap-to-pay support: Wireless printed was already present in the previous versions but, in this version, you can decide to desactivate the printer services you don't use (available HP and Samsung)
* Options to set default messaging and launcher apps: good way yo set default apps and now you can decide to use only Hangouts for messages and not receive messages twice.
* Transparent status bar: it was already present in the previous version
* Better stability: I don't have enough hours on this version, but right now it's ok without a phone reset. To check the battery drain it's seems ok but sometime I see an abnormal drain.
