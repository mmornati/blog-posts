## The Hidden Cost of AI Coding Assistants

If you're using AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, or Claude, you might not realize how much you're spending on context. Every time your AI needs to understand your codebase, it consumes **tokens**: the currency of large language models (LLMs).

**But what are tokens, exactly?**

Think of tokens as the "words" that AI models understand. They're not exactly words, but pieces of text:

* `"Hello, world!"` = 4 tokens
    
* A 500-line Python file ≈ 2,000–4,000 tokens
    
* Your entire codebase? Potentially hundreds of thousands of tokens
    

And here's the kicker: **you pay for every token**. With GPT-4o, that's $2.50 per million input tokens and $10 per million output tokens. It adds up fast.

---

## The Problem: Traditional Context is Expensive

When an AI assistant needs to understand your code, it typically does one of these things:

| Method | Token Cost | Problem |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Read entire files | 1,000–10,000+ tokens/file | Most content is irrelevant |
| Search with grep | Variable | No semantic understanding |
| Paste code manually | User overhead | Error-prone, incomplete |
| Load entire codebase | 50,000–500,000+ tokens | Exceeds most context windows |

**Real example**: To understand how a search function works in a project, an AI might need to read:

* `server.py` (1,405 lines → **10,270 tokens**)
    
* `database.py` (554 lines → **3,514 tokens**)
    

That's **13,784 tokens** just to find a few relevant functions.

---

## The Solution: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

RAG is a technique that retrieves only the relevant pieces of information before sending them to the AI. Instead of dumping entire files into the context, RAG:

1. **Pre-indexes** your codebase into semantic chunks (functions, classes, documentation sections)
    
2. **Searches** for the most relevant chunks using vector similarity
    
3. **Returns only what's needed** (typically 500–2,000 characters per result)
    

**Same example with RAG**:

* Search for "search semantic similarity" → returns 5 targeted chunks
    
* Token cost: **1,679 tokens** (vs 13,784)
    
* **Savings: 87.8%**

## Real Benchmark Results

I built a [benchmark script](https://github.com/mmornati/nexus-dev/blob/main/scripts/benchmark_rag_efficiency.py) to measure actual token savings using **live RAG searches** against an indexed codebase.

### Verified Results (Real RAG Searches)

These results use **actual semantic search** against the nexus-dev project's indexed database:

| Test Case | Without RAG | With RAG | Savings |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Find embedding function | 3,883 tokens | 575 tokens | **85.2%** |
| Understand search flow | 13,784 tokens | 1,679 tokens | **87.8%** |
| How chunking works | 2,264 tokens | 551 tokens | **75.7%** |
| MCP gateway routing | 5,064 tokens | 2,958 tokens | **41.6%** |
| Lesson recording system | 13,784 tokens | 1,664 tokens | **87.9%** |
| **Total** | **38,779 tokens** | **7,427 tokens** | **80.8%** |

> **Note**: The "MCP gateway routing" case shows lower savings (41.6%) because the RAG search returned one large chunk (2,174 tokens). This demonstrates that RAG effectiveness depends on how your code is chunked: smaller, focused functions yield better savings.

### What the RAG Search Actually Returns

For "Find embedding function", instead of 585 lines of `embeddings.py`, RAG returns:

```plaintext
🔍 embed: 55 tokens          (core embedding function)
🔍 embed_batch: 207 tokens   (batch processing)  
🔍 embed: 59 tokens          (alternative implementation)
🔍 _get_embedder: 92 tokens  (factory function)
🔍 embed: 162 tokens         (another variant)
─────────────────────────────
Total: 575 tokens (vs 3,883 for full file)
```

### Cost Impact

Using GPT-4o pricing ($2.50/1M input tokens):

| Metric | Without RAG | With RAG | Monthly Savings\* |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Per task | 38,779 tokens | 7,427 tokens | — |
| Per session (10 tasks) | ~388K tokens | ~74K tokens | — |
| 200 sessions/month | 77.6M tokens | 14.8M tokens | — |
| **Monthly cost** | **$194** | **$37** | **$157/month** |

\*Assuming 200 coding sessions per month with 10 context retrievals each

## How RAG Works (For Non-Experts)

Let me break down RAG without the jargon:

### Step 1: Indexing (One-Time Setup)

```plaintext
Your Code                    Vector Database
┌─────────────────┐         ┌─────────────────┐
│ def login():    │         │ [0.12, 0.45...] │ ← "login function"
│   check_auth()  │   →     │ [0.33, 0.21...] │ ← "authentication"
│   ...           │         │ [0.67, 0.89...] │ ← "user session"
└─────────────────┘         └─────────────────┘
```

Each function, class, and documentation section is converted into a **vector**: a list of numbers that represents its meaning. Similar concepts have similar vectors.

### Step 2: Searching (Every Query)

When you ask "how does authentication work?", RAG:

1. Converts your question into a vector
    
2. Finds the most similar vectors in the database
    
3. Returns the corresponding code chunks
    

```plaintext
Query: "authentication"
   ↓
Vector: [0.35, 0.22, ...]
   ↓
Match: login() function (similarity: 0.92)
   ↓
Return: Just the relevant 50 lines, not the entire file
```

### Step 3: AI Response

The AI receives only the relevant chunks, answers your question, and you save tokens.

## Tools to Measure Your Own Token Usage

### LiteLLM (Free, Open-Source)

[LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) is an open-source proxy that logs every LLM request with token counts and costs.

**Quick setup:**

```bash
# Install
pip install litellm

# Run as proxy
litellm --model openai/gpt-4o --port 4000
```

Then point your AI tools at `http://localhost:4000` instead of the OpenAI API directly. LiteLLM logs:

* Input/output token counts
    
* Cost per request
    
* Latency
    

**View the dashboard:**

```bash
litellm --config config.yaml --detailed_debug
# Dashboard at http://localhost:4000/ui
```

### OpenAI Usage Dashboard

If you're using OpenAI directly, check your [usage dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/usage) to see daily token consumption.

## Implementing RAG for Your Codebase

### Option 1: Nexus-Dev (MCP Server)

[Nexus-Dev](https://github.com/mmornati/nexus-dev) is an open-source project that provides RAG as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. It works with Cursor, Copilot, Antigravity, and other MCP-compatible tools.

```bash
# Install
pip install nexus-dev

# Initialize your project
cd your-project
nexus-init --project-name "my-project"

# Index your code
nexus-index src/ docs/ -r
```

Now your AI assistant can use semantic search instead of reading entire files.

### Option 2: LangChain + Vector DB

For custom implementations, use LangChain with a vector database like LanceDB, Pinecone, or ChromaDB:

```python
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import LanceDB

# Index code
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vectorstore = LanceDB.from_documents(documents, embeddings)

# Search
results = vectorstore.similarity_search("authentication function", k=5)
```

## When NOT to Use RAG

RAG isn't always the best choice:

| Situation | Better Approach |
| --- | --- |
| Small files (&lt;100 lines) | Just read the file directly |
| Need full context (refactoring) | Read entire file |
| One-time questions | Manual paste is fine |
| No semantic similarity (config files) | Grep/find works better |

RAG shines when:

* ✅ You have a large codebase (&gt;10K lines)
    
* ✅ You ask repeated questions about the same code
    
* ✅ You need cross-project knowledge
    
* ✅ You want to reduce ongoing costs
    

---

## MCP Gateway for Tool Consolidation

Beyond RAG for code search, there's another token efficiency win: **tool consolidation**.

### The Problem: Tool Definitions Are Expensive

Every MCP tool you expose to an AI consumes tokens in the system prompt. Each tool definition includes:

* Name and description (~20-50 tokens)
    
* Parameter schemas with types and descriptions (~50-150 tokens)
    

With multiple MCP servers, this adds up quickly:

| Servers | Tools | Tokens in System Prompt |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub only | 10 | 1,508 |
| \+ Home Assistant | 18 | 2,278 |
| \+ Filesystem | 26 | 2,892 |
| \+ Database + Slack | 36 | **3,678** |

And there's a hard limit: **VS Code and OpenAI cap tools at 128 per request**.

### The Solution: Gateway Consolidation

Instead of exposing all 36 tools directly, nexus-dev's gateway approach exposes just **3 meta-tools**:

1. `search_tools` - Find tools by natural language description
    
2. `get_tool_schema` - Get full parameter details for a tool
    
3. `invoke_tool` - Execute any backend tool
    

### Benchmark Results

| Metric | Direct Exposure | Gateway | Reduction |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tools in prompt | 36 | 3 | 33 fewer |
| Tokens per request | 3,678 | 486 | **86.8%** |

### The Trade-off

The gateway isn't free: it requires an extra call to discover tools:

```plaintext
Traditional: [Request with 36 tools] → Response
Gateway:     [Request with 3 tools] → search_tools → invoke_tool → Response
```

**When is the gateway worth it?**

* ✅ More than ~10 tools across servers (break-even point)
    
* ✅ Tools you don't use every request
    
* ✅ Approaching the 128 tool limit
    
* ❌ Only 2-3 frequently-used tools (direct exposure is simpler)
    

### Run the Benchmark

```bash
python scripts/benchmark_gateway_tools.py --servers github,homeassistant,filesystem
```

## Impact Analysis

### Per-Request Savings

* **2,406 tokens saved** per request
    
* At $2.50/1M tokens (GPT-4o input): **$0.006015** per request
    

### Session Savings (100 requests/session)

* Tokens saved: 240,600
    
* Cost saved: $0.6015
    

### Monthly Savings (1000 sessions × 100 requests)

* Tokens saved: 240,600,000
    
* Cost saved: $601.50

## Key Takeaways

1. **Token costs add up fast**: Reading files directly can consume 20x more tokens than needed
    
2. **RAG reduces context costs by 80%+**: By returning only relevant chunks
    
3. **Tool definitions are hidden costs**: 36 exposed tools = 3,678 tokens every request
    
4. **Gateway consolidation saves 86%**: 36 tools → 3 meta-tools = massive savings
    
5. **Measure before optimizing**: Use the benchmark scripts on your actual setup
    
6. **There are trade-offs**: Gateway adds discovery calls, but saves on baseline
