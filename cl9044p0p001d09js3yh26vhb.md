# Nexus 7: restore to factory default

Even if I never "hacked" my Nexus device after some month (I suppose due to application installation), my device crashes and, after reboot, i was stuck on Google boot image.
I try to leave it an hour booting with no success. So... factory reset.
Yes, but... how I can run a factory reset for a crashed device? Reading online there are some forum posts with combination that I honestly didn't understand.

Here the combination I tested many time to wipe your device:
<ol>
	<li>Reboot your device pressing <strong>Power Button</strong> + <strong>Sound <em>Down</em> Button</strong>, at the same time until you can see the fast boot menu
<a href="http://www.r33net.de/wp-uploads/2012/11/and.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.r33net.de/wp-uploads/2012/11/and.png" width="121" height="175" /></a></li>
	<li>Using volume buttons move to <em>Recovery Mode</em> menu and then start it using the power button</li>
	<li>Your Nexus 7 will reboot and, after a while, you should see the android robot with a red <em>exclamation mark</em> and the information <em>no data</em> on the screen.</li>
	<li>Here press <strong>Power Button</strong> + <strong> Sound Up Button</strong> at the <em>same time</em><strong> </strong>for about <strong>2 seconds</strong> and then release the two buttons at the same time. Recovery menu should appear</li>
	<li>Here you can choose, moving into menu with the sound buttons, the <em>Wipe Data</em> menu (and if you want <em>Wipe Cache</em>)</li>
	<li>At the end you have a <em>Reboot </em>entry into menu to restart your device.</li>
</ol>
Hope this help
