Home automation has transformed how we interact with our living spaces, offering unprecedented control, convenience, and efficiency. Today, I’m thrilled to introduce a custom integration that bridges the gap between Hitachi devices and HomeAssistant to allow better-integrated automations.

### Why This Automation?

Hitachi recently significantly changed their approach to connecting wireless modules to their devices. These changes, while aimed at simplifying their ecosystem, introduced new challenges for smart home enthusiasts:

* **Simplified Hardware:** Hitachi transitioned from requiring two expensive modules for wireless connectivity to a single, more cost-effective module.

* **Limited Connectivity Options:** The new module is designed to connect exclusively through the official application and website, removing previously available options like APIs or Modbus.
    
* **Discovering the Solution:** An analysis of how the official website communicates with the devices identified a list of URLs containing the necessary information to control the devices. This discovery became the foundation for building this custom automation.
    

This integration bridges the gap by leveraging these insights, enabling seamless control of Hitachi devices within the Home Assistant ecosystem.

**NOTE:** As I own only a Hitachi Yutaki Head Pump, I don’t know how the integration can fit with the other brand devices.

### Key Features of the Integration

This custom integration, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mmornati/home-assistant-csnet-home), brings powerful capabilities to your smart home setup, including:

* **Device Support:** Seamlessly integrates with Hitachi appliances using the CS-Net communication protocol.
    
* **Real-Time Monitoring:** View status updates and diagnostics directly within Home Assistant.
    
* **Full Control:** Adjust device parameters such as temperature, mode, and power state remotely.
    
* **Automation-Ready:** Leverage Home Assistant’s automation engine to create rules and triggers based on device activity.
    

### How It Works

This integration leverages the CS-Net protocol to communicate with supported Hitachi devices. Once installed, it establishes a connection between Home Assistant and your appliances, enabling bidirectional communication for control and status updates. The setup process is straightforward and requires minimal technical expertise.  
It uses the provided CSNet Home credentials to enable the communication and, when errors occur it re-authenticate the integration. There is so far not a better or proper way to interact with it.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Installation

Here’s how to get started:

1. **Download the Integration:** Add the integration repository to the HACS Custom repositories.
    
2. **Install:** Install the integration by looking for “csnet” or “hitachi” in the list of hacs available integration.
    
3. **Restart Home Assistant:** Reload your instance to activate the integration.
    
4. **Add the new Integration:** going to the “Devices” section and add the new integration (looking with the same kind of filters used to find it in HACS)
    
5. **Configure:** The installation process will ask in the UI for your credentials and, everything goes fine it will display the found climate devices asking for their location.
    

For detailed steps, troubleshooting tips, and additional configuration options, refer to the [documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/mmornati/home-assistant-csnet-home).

### Real-World Use Cases

This integration opens the door to numerous possibilities:

* **Energy Savings:** Automate your Hitachi air conditioner to maintain optimal temperatures during peak hours and reduce usage when not needed.
    
* **Comfort Automation:** Pair your Hitachi devices with motion sensors to adjust settings based on room occupancy.
    
* **Unified Ecosystem:** Integrate your Hitachi appliances with other smart devices, such as thermostats, lights, and voice assistants, for seamless control.
    

### What’s Next?

This is just the beginning. Future updates will include:

* **Expanded Device Support:** Adding compatibility with more Hitachi products.
    
* **Community Contributions:** Welcoming feedback, bug reports, and feature requests from the Home Assistant community.
    

### Conclusion

This custom integration for Home Assistant empowers users to unlock the full potential of their Hitachi devices, bringing them into the modern smart home ecosystem. With enhanced control, energy savings, and comfort at your fingertips, it’s time to take your home automation to the next level.
