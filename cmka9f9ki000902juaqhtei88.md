If you've been using MCP servers with Cursor, VS Code, or other AI-powered IDEs, you've probably encountered this dreaded warning:

> ⚠️ "You have configured more than 50 tools. This may degrade performance."

Modern AI coding agents connect to multiple MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers: GitHub, PostgreSQL, Filesystem, Slack, Jira... Each server exposes multiple tools. Before you know it, you're at 50+ tools, and your AI agent starts struggling.

In this article, I'll explain why this happens and how [Nexus-Dev](https://github.com/mmornati/nexus-dev) solves it with a **Gateway architecture** that reduces tool count from 50+ down to just 11.

## Quick Context: What is MCP?

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is a standard introduced by Anthropic in November 2024 that allows AI assistants to connect to external tools and data sources. When you install a GitHub MCP server, your AI can create issues, open PRs, and manage repositories.

The problem? Each MCP server adds more tools to your AI's context, and there's a limit to how many tools work well together.

## The Problem: Tool Explosion

### How Tools Consume Context

When you configure MCP servers, each tool's definition (name, description, parameters) gets injected into the AI's context window:

| MCP Server | Typical Tools |
| --- | --- |
| GitHub | 15-20 (issues, PRs, repos...) |
| PostgreSQL | 5-10 (query, tables...) |
| Filesystem | 8-12 (read, write, list...) |
| Slack | 10-15 (messages, channels...) |

**5 servers × 10 tools = 50 tools** consuming precious context.

### Why Performance Degrades

Research shows that AI accuracy can drop from 87% to 54% with context overload. Each tool definition takes tokens away from your actual code and conversation. Platforms like Cursor enforce a hard limit around 40-50 tools to prevent this.

### But What About Per-Project Configuration?

Modern IDEs now support project-level MCP configuration:

* **VS Code**: `.vscode/mcp.json`
    
* **Cursor**: `.cursor/mcp.json`
    

This is better than global configuration: you only load relevant servers per project. But even a typical full-stack project might need GitHub + Database + Cloud + Monitoring + Communication tools. That's still 40+ tools for a single project.

## The Solution: Nexus-Dev as a Gateway

Instead of exposing all tools directly, Nexus-Dev acts as a **gateway**: a single MCP server that proxies requests to any number of backend servers.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1768167088649/8d26be15-c3f7-4ab5-961d-aac343c8df3d.png align="center")

The key insight: **Your AI agent only sees 11 tools, but can access all 50+ through dynamic discovery.**

### How It Works

1. **AI asks**: "I need to create a GitHub issue"
    
2. **Nexus-Dev searches** its RAG index: finds `github.create_issue`
    
3. **AI invokes**: `invoke_tool("github", "create_issue", {...})`
    
4. **Nexus-Dev proxies** the request to GitHub MCP
    
5. **Result returned** to AI
    

All through just 11 gateway tools, not 50+.

## The 11 Gateway Tools

Instead of exposing 50+ tools directly, your AI sees:

**RAG Tools (7)**: from the [previous article](/blog/nexus-dev-rag-blog-post):

* `search_code`, `search_docs`, `search_lessons`, `search_knowledge`
    
* `index_file`, `record_lesson`, `get_project_context`
    

**Gateway Tools (4)**: for accessing any backend:

| Tool | What It Does |
| --- | --- |
| `list_servers` | Show available MCP backends |
| `search_tools` | Find tools via semantic search |
| `get_tool_schema` | Get full parameter schema |
| `invoke_tool` | Execute tool on any backend |

## Implementation: How It Works

### 1\. Index Tool Documentation

First, index all your MCP servers' tools into the RAG database:

```bash
# Index all configured servers
nexus-index-mcp --all

# Or index a specific server
nexus-index-mcp --server github
```

This stores each tool's description and schema for semantic search.

### 2\. Semantic Tool Discovery

When the AI asks "how do I create a GitHub issue?", it calls `search_tools`:

```python
# search_tools("create github issue")
# Returns: github.create_issue - Creates a new issue
#          Parameters: owner, repo, title, body...
```

The AI finds the right tool by meaning, not by knowing every tool name upfront.

### 3\. Tool Invocation with Error Handling

```python
# AI invokes through the gateway
invoke_tool("github", "create_issue", {
    "owner": "mmornati",
    "repo": "nexus-dev",
    "title": "Fix login bug"
})
```

Nexus-Dev handles:

* Connection pooling and reuse
    
* Automatic retry with exponential backoff
    
* Configurable timeouts
    
* Clean error messages
    

### 4\. Server Configuration

Servers are configured in `.nexus/mcp_config.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "servers": {
    "github": {
      "transport": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "${GITHUB_TOKEN}"
      }
    },
    "postgres": {
      "transport": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres", "postgresql://..."]
    }
  }
}
```

Two transport types supported:

* **stdio**: Local processes (npm packages, python scripts)
    
* **sse**: Remote HTTP servers (cloud-hosted MCP endpoints)
    

## Quick Setup

```bash
# Import from your existing global MCP config
nexus-mcp init --from-global

# Or add servers manually
nexus-mcp add github --command "npx" --args "-y" \
  --args "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"

# Index all tool documentation
nexus-index-mcp --all
```

Update your IDE to use only Nexus-Dev:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nexus-dev": { "command": "nexus-dev" }
  }
}
```

That's it. One server. 11 tools. Access to everything.

## Before vs After

### Before: Traditional Setup

```plaintext
IDE Config:
  github:         (15 tools)
  postgres:       (8 tools)
  filesystem:     (10 tools)
  slack:          (12 tools)
  linear:         (8 tools)
  
Total: 53 tools in context
⚠️ Warning: Too many tools
```

### After: Gateway

```plaintext
IDE Config:
  nexus-dev:      (11 tools)
  
✅ All 53+ tools accessible via gateway
✅ Minimal context usage
✅ No performance degradation
```

## Real Example

```plaintext
You: "Create a GitHub issue for the login bug"

AI: Let me find the right tool...
    [search_tools("create github issue")]
    
    Found: github.create_issue
    
    [invoke_tool("github", "create_issue", {
        "owner": "mmornati",
        "repo": "nexus-dev",
        "title": "Fix login redirect loop",
        "labels": ["bug"]
    })]
    
    ✅ Issue #42 created
```

All through Nexus-Dev's 11 tools.

## Benefits Summary

| Traditional | Gateway |
| --- | --- |
| 50+ tools in context | 11 tools in context |
| Configure each server in IDE | Configure only Nexus-Dev |
| IDE restart to add servers | `nexus-mcp add` dynamically |
| AI must know exact tool names | Semantic search finds tools |

## Conclusion

The MCP ecosystem is growing fast, and tool explosion is a real problem. By using Nexus-Dev as a gateway:

* Your AI agent sees only 11 tools
    
* It can access 50+ tools through semantic search
    
* Context usage stays minimal
    
* Configuration stays simple
    

Combined with the RAG capabilities from the [previous article](https://blog.mornati.net/stop-repeating-yourself-to-ai-how-i-built-a-local-rag-system-for-coding-assistants), Nexus-Dev becomes a complete solution for making your AI coding agent smarter and more efficient.
