# Completed blog migration: from WordPress to Ghost

After years using Wordpress for my personal blog, I decided to test something new. Wordpress works very well, but I think is became too heavy for a simple blog in the latests versions...
Anyway... I found <a href="http://tryghost.org">Ghost</a>, a NodeJS blogging platform, that is actually in strong development but with all basic functionalities already.

The only thing I want to share for the moment is the performance test comparison. Sure, Wordpress does not have exactly the same theme and could surely be better...
