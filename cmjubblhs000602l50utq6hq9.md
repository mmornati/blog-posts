## Introduction

Cyber Code Academy is a modern, gamified platform for mastering Python through interactive challenges, real-time competitions, and AI-powered problem generation. While students focus on solving coding challenges, administrators need robust tools to create, manage, and monitor the platform's content and infrastructure.

In this post, we'll take a deep dive into the admin section, a comprehensive suite of tools that simplifies everything from challenge creation to infrastructure monitoring. We'll explore how we leverage JSON storage, semantic validation, AI-powered generation, translation services, and Docker-based execution to create a scalable and maintainable platform.

## Challenge Management: Flexible Test Storage and Semantic Validation

### JSON-Based Test Storage

One of the core design decisions in Cyber Code Academy was to store challenge tests as JSON in PostgreSQL's JSONB columns. This approach provides several advantages:

* **Flexibility**: Tests can have different structures (assertion-based, output-based, or custom validation)
    
* **Queryability**: PostgreSQL's JSONB operators allow us to query and filter challenges by test properties
    
* **Versioning**: Easy to track changes to test suites over time
    
* **No Schema Migrations**: Adding new test types doesn't require database migrations
    

Each challenge stores its tests in a JSONB array like this:

```json
{
  "tests": [
    {
      "name": "test_basic",
      "code": "assert solve([1, 2, 3]) == 6",
      "hidden": false
    },
    {
      "name": "test_edge_case",
      "code": "assert solve([]) == 0",
      "hidden": true
    }
  ]
}
```

The database model uses SQLAlchemy's `JSONB` type to store this flexible structure:

```python
tests = Column(JSONB, nullable=False)  # Array of test objects
```

*The challenge editor shows an UI over JSON structure of tests, making it easy to understand and modify test cases*

### Semantic Validation: Beyond Test Results

While unit tests verify that code produces correct outputs, they don't ensure that students are learning the intended concepts. A student might solve a challenge using a workaround or unintended approach that passes all tests but misses the educational objective.

This is where **semantic validation** comes in. We've implemented a two-tier validation system:

#### AST-Based Validation (Fast & Deterministic)

For challenges that require specific code patterns or structures, we use Python's **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** module to perform fast, deterministic validation. The AST validator can check for:

* Required function definitions
    
* Prohibited imports or functions
    
* Required control structures (loops, conditionals)
    
* Code complexity constraints
    
* Specific algorithm requirements
    

The AST validator parses the code into an AST and uses a visitor pattern to check constraints:

```python
class ASTValidator:
    def validate(self, code: str, constraints: Dict[str, Any]) -> ValidationResult:
        tree = ast.parse(code)
        visitor = ASTConstraintVisitor(constraints)
        visitor.visit(tree)
        return ValidationResult(
            passed=len(visitor.errors) == 0,
            errors=visitor.errors,
            warnings=visitor.warnings
        )
```

This approach is:

* **Fast**: No API calls, pure Python parsing
    
* **Deterministic**: Same code always produces the same result
    
* **Precise**: Can detect specific code patterns with high accuracy
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1767200462946/2d1ca894-fd25-42de-8e63-26407cbfadf6.png align="center")

*Admins can configure semantic validation constraints for each challenge*

For admis there is a predefined prompt helping to write a proper AST JSON validator !

#### LLM-Based Validation (Flexible & Context-Aware)

For challenges where the learning objective is more nuanced, we use Large Language Models (LLMs) to validate that code follows the challenge instructions. The LLM validator:

* Understands the challenge's educational objective
    
* Checks if the code approach matches the intended learning path
    
* Provides feedback on code style and best practices
    
* Detects workarounds that pass tests but miss the point
    

The LLM validator sends the challenge objective, solution code, and user code to an AI model for analysis:

```python
class LLMValidator:
    async def validate(self, code: str, challenge: Challenge, db: AsyncSession):
        system_prompt = """You are a code validator for a Python learning platform.
        Check if the user's code follows the challenge instructions exactly."""
        
        user_prompt = f"""Challenge Objective: {challenge.description['objective']}
        Expected Approach: {challenge.solution_code}
        User Code: {code}
        
        Analyze if the user's code follows the challenge instructions."""
        
        # Call LLM with automatic usage tracking
        response = await self._call_llm_with_tracking(...)
        return self._parse_response(response)
```

#### LLM Fallback Chain: Reliability Through Redundancy

To ensure high availability and handle rate limits, we've implemented a fallback chain across three LLM providers:

1. **Groq** (Primary): Fast inference with models like `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`
    
2. **Google Gemini** (Fallback): `gemini-2.5-flash` for reliable performance
    
3. **OpenAI** (Last Resort): `gpt-4-turbo-preview` for maximum quality
    

The system automatically switches providers when:

* Rate limits are hit (HTTP 429)
    
* API errors occur
    
* Timeouts happen
    

```python
class AIModelManager:
    def handle_error(self, error: Exception, current_model: str):
        if is_rate_limit_error(error):
            self.current_index += 1
            next_model = self.get_next_model()
            return True, next_model, retry_after_seconds
        # ... handle other errors
```

This multi-provider approach ensures that semantic validation remains available even when individual providers have issues, providing a robust and reliable validation system.

## Translation System: Making Challenges Accessible Globally

Creating quality educational content is time-consuming. Translating that content into multiple languages can be prohibitively expensive and slow. To solve this, we've integrated **LibreTranslate**—an open-source translation service—to automatically translate challenges.

### Multi-Language Support with JSONB

Similar to our test storage approach, we use JSONB columns to store translations:

```python
title_i18n = Column(JSONB, nullable=True)  # {"en": "...", "fr": "..."}
description_i18n = Column(JSONB, nullable=True)  # Nested structure
hints_i18n = Column(JSONB, nullable=True)  # Array of translated hints
```

This structure allows us to:

* Store multiple languages in a single row
    
* Query by language efficiently
    
* Add new languages without schema changes
    
* Maintain translation history
    

### Auto-Translation Workflow

The translation system provides a seamless workflow for admins:

1. **Create Challenge in English**: Write the challenge with all content in English
    
2. **Auto-Translate**: Click a button to translate to target language (e.g., French)
    
3. **Review & Edit**: Review the auto-translated content and make manual adjustments
    
4. **Publish**: The challenge is now available in both languages
    

The translation service uses Redis caching to avoid redundant API calls:

```python
class TranslationService:
    async def translate(self, text: str, target_lang: str, source_lang: str):
        # Check Redis cache first
        cache_key = f"translation:{source_lang}:{target_lang}:{hash(text)}"
        cached = await self.redis.get(cache_key)
        if cached:
            return cached.decode('utf-8')
        
        # Call LibreTranslate API
        translated = await self._call_libretranslate(text, source_lang, target_lang)
        
        # Cache the result
        await self.redis.setex(cache_key, ttl, translated)
        return translated
```

This caching strategy:

* Reduces API costs
    
* Improves response times
    
* Handles repeated translations (e.g., common phrases)
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1767203103149/fb803d64-928f-47a8-b5ba-c2dc9fd74050.png align="center")

*The translation editor shows side-by-side comparison of original and translated content*

### Graceful Degradation

The translation system is designed to degrade gracefully:

* If LibreTranslate is unavailable, admins can still manually translate
    
* Cached translations remain available even if the API is down
    
* The system logs warnings but doesn't block challenge creation

## AI Challenge Generator: From Concept to Complete Challenge

Creating high-quality coding challenges is an art. It requires:

* Clear problem statements
    
* Appropriate difficulty levels
    
* Comprehensive test cases
    
* Engaging narratives (in our case, cyberpunk-themed)
    
* Validated solutions
    

To scale challenge creation, we built an **AI Challenge Generator** that can create complete challenges from simple specifications.

### How It Works

The generator takes minimal input:

* **Category**: e.g., "loops", "functions", "lists"
    
* **Difficulty**: "initiate", "hacker", "elite", or "legend"
    
* **Concept**: The educational concept to teach
    
* **Context**: A cyberpunk narrative theme
    
* **Constraints**: Optional special requirements
    

From this, it generates:

* A complete challenge description with narrative
    
* Starter code for students
    
* Solution code with comments
    
* Comprehensive test suite (visible and hidden tests)
    
* Hints for struggling students
    

### The Generation Process

1. **Prompt Engineering**: The system uses carefully crafted prompts that instruct the AI to:
    
    * Follow the cyberpunk theme
        
    * Create progressive difficulty
        
    * Include comprehensive tests
        
    * Return valid JSON matching our schema
        
2. **Schema Validation**: Generated JSON is validated against a JSON Schema to ensure:
    
    * All required fields are present
        
    * Data types are correct
        
    * Structure matches our challenge model
        
3. **Solution Testing**: The generated solution code is automatically executed against the generated tests to verify:
    
    * All tests pass
        
    * The solution is correct
        
    * No syntax errors exist
        
4. **Refinement Loop**: If tests fail, the system:
    
    * Sends the error back to the AI
        
    * Requests corrections
        
    * Re-validates until tests pass (up to 3 attempts)
        

```python
async def generate_challenge(self, category, difficulty, concept, context):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        # Call AI with model fallback
        response = await self._call_llm(messages, model=current_model)
        challenge_json = self._extract_json(response)
        
        # Validate schema
        self._validate_schema(challenge_json)
        
        # Test solution
        test_result = await self._test_solution(challenge_json)
        if not test_result["passed"]:
            # Request correction
            messages.append({"role": "user", "content": refinement_prompt})
            continue
        
        return challenge_json
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1767203187505/e17f3549-d532-4602-916c-6886367f7f56.png align="center")

*Admins can generate complete challenges with just a few inputs*

### Model Fallback for Reliability

The generator uses the same multi-provider fallback system as semantic validation:

* Tries Groq first (fast and cost-effective)
    
* Falls back to Gemini if rate limited
    
* Uses OpenAI as last resort for maximum quality
    

This ensures challenge generation remains available even during provider outages.

## AI Usage Tracking: Understanding Costs and Performance

When using multiple AI providers with different pricing models, understanding usage and costs becomes critical. We've built comprehensive tracking that logs every AI API call.

### What We Track

For every AI call, we log:

* **Provider & Model**: Which service and model was used
    
* **Call Type**: Generation, refinement, or validation
    
* **Status**: Success, error, or rate limit
    
* **Performance**: Response time in milliseconds
    
* **Token Usage**: Input tokens, output tokens, total tokens
    
* **Cost Estimation**: Estimated cost based on provider pricing
    
* **Rate Limit Info**: Retry-after headers and rate limit status
    
* **Metadata**: Full response headers, error details, and context
    

This data is stored in the `ai_call_logs` table:

```python
class AICallLog(Base):
    provider = Column(String(50), nullable=False, index=True)
    model = Column(String(100), nullable=False, index=True)
    call_type = Column(String(50), nullable=False)
    status = Column(String(20), nullable=False, index=True)
    response_time_ms = Column(Integer, nullable=True)
    input_tokens = Column(Integer, nullable=True)
    output_tokens = Column(Integer, nullable=True)
    total_tokens = Column(Integer, nullable=True)
    cost_estimate = Column(Numeric(10, 6), nullable=True)
    # ... more fields
```

### Usage Dashboard

The admin dashboard provides comprehensive analytics:

* **Total Usage**: Calls, tokens, and costs over time
    
* **Provider Breakdown**: Which providers are used most
    
* **Model Performance**: Success rates and response times per model
    
* **Cost Analysis**: Spending trends and projections
    
* **Error Tracking**: Rate limits, failures, and retry patterns
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1767203242295/10dc07bb-a5a7-4fde-88e8-5952dc5869c7.png align="center")

*The AI usage dashboard shows comprehensive statistics on API calls, costs, and performance*

### Automatic Tracking

Every AI call is automatically tracked without requiring manual instrumentation:

```python
async def _call_llm_with_tracking(self, provider, model, prompts, db):
    # Create call log entry
    call_log = AICallLog(
        provider=provider_name,
        model=model_name,
        status=CallStatus.PENDING.value
    )
    db.add(call_log)
    await db.flush()
    
    try:
        # Make API call
        response = await provider.generate_text(...)
        
        # Update with success data
        call_log.status = CallStatus.SUCCESS.value
        call_log.input_tokens = response.usage.input_tokens
        call_log.output_tokens = response.usage.output_tokens
        call_log.cost_estimate = calculate_cost(...)
    except Exception as e:
        # Update with error data
        call_log.status = CallStatus.ERROR.value
        call_log.error_message = str(e)
    
    return response
```

This automatic tracking ensures we never miss a call and can accurately analyze costs and performance.

## Executor Monitoring: Ensuring Reliable Code Execution

Code execution is the heart of a coding platform. Students submit code, and the system must execute it securely and reliably. We use Docker containers for isolation, and comprehensive monitoring to ensure everything works correctly.

### Docker-Based Secure Execution

Each code submission runs in an isolated Docker container with:

* **Resource Limits**: CPU and memory constraints
    
* **Network Isolation**: No external network access
    
* **Timeout Enforcement**: Automatic termination of long-running code
    
* **Clean Environment**: Fresh container for each execution
    

The executor service manages a pool of containers to handle concurrent submissions efficiently.

### Health Monitoring

The admin section provides real-time monitoring of the executor infrastructure:

* **Docker Connection**: Is Docker daemon accessible?
    
* **Image Status**: Is the executor image present and up-to-date?
    
* **Pool Metrics**: Current pool size, active executions, available slots
    
* **Utilization**: Percentage of pool capacity in use
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1767203296532/f2d39127-ae43-49ed-9df0-31a72e5fbd06.png align="center")

*Real-time monitoring of executor pool health and status*

### Execution Statistics

Beyond health checks, the system tracks:

* **Total Executions**: Number of code runs over time
    
* **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful executions
    
* **Average Execution Time**: Performance metrics
    
* **User Statistics**: Per-user execution patterns
    
* **Challenge Statistics**: Which challenges have the most submissions
    

### Debugging Failed Tests

When AI-generated tests fail or students report issues, admins need to debug. The executor monitoring system provides:

* **Execution History**: View all executions with filters (user, challenge, date range)
    
* **Failed Execution Logs**: Full stdout/stderr for failed runs
    
* **Test Results**: Detailed test output showing which tests passed/failed
    

This is particularly valuable for AI-generated challenges. Even after manual review, some edge cases might be missed. The execution logs help identify:

* Test cases that are too strict
    
* Edge cases not covered by tests
    
* Performance issues with test execution
    
* Syntax errors in generated test code
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1767203339878/0afab2a8-3170-4ef2-9c1f-aa7c0b460ffa.png align="center")

*Admins can view detailed logs from failed executions to debug test issues*

### Example: Debugging an AI-Generated Test

Imagine an AI-generated challenge has a test that's failing unexpectedly:

1. Admin views the challenge in the admin panel
    
2. Checks execution history for that challenge
    
3. Finds a failed execution
    
4. Views the execution logs
    
5. Sees the test error: `AssertionError: Expected [1, 2, 3] but got [1, 2, 3]`
    
6. Realizes the test is comparing lists with `==` which works, but the error message suggests a different issue
    
7. Reviews the test code and fixes the assertion
    
8. Re-tests the challenge
    

This workflow makes it easy to identify and fix issues in AI-generated content, ensuring quality even when challenges are created automatically.

## Conclusion

The admin section of Cyber Code Academy demonstrates how thoughtful tooling can simplify complex platform management. By leveraging:

* **JSONB storage** for flexible, queryable data structures
    
* **Semantic validation** (AST + LLM) to ensure educational quality
    
* **Multi-provider AI fallback** for reliability
    
* **Auto-translation** to scale content globally
    
* **AI generation** to create challenges at scale
    
* **Comprehensive logging** to understand costs and performance
    
* **Executor monitoring** to ensure reliable code execution
    

We've created a platform that can scale from a few challenges to thousands, from one language to many, and from manual creation to AI-assisted generation—all while maintaining quality and reliability.

The admin tools don't just make life easier for administrators; they enable the platform to grow and evolve. As we add more challenges, support more languages, and leverage AI more extensively, these tools ensure we can manage complexity without sacrificing quality.
