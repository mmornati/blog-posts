# Migration Wordpress to Ghost: two weeks later

Twe weeks ago I migrated my blog from Wordpress to Ghost platform. Even if actually I'm loosing some useful resource/util I loved in Wordpress, Ghost it's really awesome and easy to use.

Here you are some screenshots taken from Google Webmaster tools.

It's really impressive I think and not difficult to find the migration moment on this latest graph :D
