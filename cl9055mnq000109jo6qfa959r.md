# Logio Puppet Modules: automatic installation

I created a puppet module allowing you to automatically install logio server and/or harvester (logio client).

https://github.com/mmornati/puppet-logio

As you can see into the readme file, the usage of this module is really simple.

## Server installation

To install the server you just need to include on your node definition the module ''logio::server''. With an external node yaml classifier, for example, the configuration should be:

<pre class="language-yaml"><code class="language-yaml">---
classes:
   logio::server:
</code></pre>

## Harvester (client) installation

To install a client you have the ''logio::harvester'' module. You can simply add this module on your node definition, with the server parameter poiting to your logio server ip address:

<pre class="language-yaml"><code class="language-yaml">---
classes:
   logio::harvester:
      logio_server: 127.0.0.1
</code></pre>

## Add Logs and/or Streams

To add a new log for your servers you can modify the templates ''templates/harvester.conf.erb''. You can simply add a new log file path to the default stream (system) or create a new stream with logs for it.
Here for example a templates including apache logs:

<pre class="language-puppet"><code class="language-puppet">exports.config = {
nodeName: "<%= fqdn %>",
  logStreams: {
    system: [
      "/var/log/messages",
      "/var/log/secure"
    ],
    apache: [
      "/var/log/httpd/access_log",
      "/var/log/httpd/error_log",
    ],
  },
  server: {
    host: '<%= logio_server %>',
    port: 28777
  }
}</code></pre>

You can then simply access to your installed logio server, pointing your browser to:

`http://logio.ip.address:28778`

where *logio.ip.address* the the machine's address or dnsname of your logio server.
All harvester will then send new logs with a socket connection to your browser.
